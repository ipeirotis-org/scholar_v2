## Collaboration

- [ ] **Reply to Florian Ederer re Shapley value citation attribution**
  - Email thread started by John Horton intro (April 2025)
  - Florian (economist at BU) wants per-author citation adjustment for tenure committees
  - Proposed Shapley values for citations on scholar-analytics.org
  - Florian shared Nature paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13130-4
  - Draft reply mentions PNAS paper on co-citation analysis + Google Scholar blocking crawlers
  - Next step: send draft reply, then schedule a call to discuss collaboration

- [ ] **Read and analyze papers on citation credit allocation**
  - [ ] Shen & Barabasi (2014) "Collective credit allocation in science" -- https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1401992111
    - Uses co-citation patterns to infer per-author contribution to a paper's impact
  - [ ] Hasan & King (2019) "Spillover effects of intellectual property protection in the inter-war period" -- https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13130-4
    - Shared by Florian Ederer; relevant to citation attribution methodology

## Future Features

- [ ] **REST API for authors, publications, and stats** _(from #28)_
  - Expose data as JSON API endpoints (separate from the HTML frontend)
  - Enables third-party integrations and programmatic access
  - Could be a separate Cloud Run service or part of the frontend with `/api/` routes

- [ ] **Migrate frontend to API + client-side JS** _(from #6)_
  - Replace Jinja server-rendered templates with API calls + JavaScript
  - Aligns with client-side charting direction (Chart.js/Plotly)
  - Added benefit: exposes a usable API for external consumers

- [ ] **Field-specific benchmarks** _(from #12)_
  - Allow users to compare against their field (business, CS, biology, etc.)
  - Show number of people included per field, field-specific percentiles

- [ ] **Crossref integration for publication metadata** _(from #20)_
  - Query Crossref to find DOIs and enriched metadata for publications in our dataset
  - Colab notebook exists: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14WhIOthRkVMWp0r3O86PYVHTQ0CuipeT
  - Consider bulk importing the 120M entries dataset (publications until 2020)

- [ ] **Author comparison feature**
  - Side-by-side PiP-AUC and percentile plots for multiple authors

- [ ] **Dynamic region rotation per-request** instead of fixed at import time
  - Currently `Config.FUNCTION_LOCATION` is set once when the module loads
  - Long-running Cloud Run instances may use the same region for days
